## 2 **INTRODUCTION**

We at Magickbase team (“we”, “us”, or “our”) understand that our users care about how their Personal Data (as defined below) is handled. This Privacy Policy describes our data processing activities and practices when visitors and users access or use Platform, our related websites, services, functionalities, applications, software, API(s), subscription plans, products, and content.

Please take a moment to read this Privacy Policy carefully. You may contact us in the manner stated in this Privacy Policy if you have any questions. 

This Privacy Policy supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consents you may have previously provided to us in respect of your Personal Data, and any consents you may have provided in connection with this Privacy Policy are cumulative and additional to any rights which we may have under applicable law to handle or process your Personal Data.

We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. While you should regularly check this Privacy Policy and determine if any such revision has taken place by referring to the date on which this Privacy Policy was last updated, we may also notify you of updates to this Privacy Policy in any form as we may deem appropriate or, where required by applicable law, by posting a notice or reaching you via other forms of communication. 

## 3 ‍**ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

By interacting with us, submitting information to us, or signing up for any of our products or services on our websites, you agree and consent to our processing of your Personal Data, including by our authorised service providers, in the manner and for any of our purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

If you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any aspect of this Privacy Policy, you should immediately discontinue access or use of our websites and services.**‍**

## 4 **COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA**‍

"Personal Data" means: (a) any data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; or (b) “personal data,” “personal information,” “personally identifiable information” or similar term as defined under applicable data protection laws.

The amount and types of Personal Data that we collect and process depends on the nature of your interaction with us. Generally, we may collect and process the following:

1. Account and profile information, such as email addresses, passwords and/or blockchain wallet addresses;
2. Payment and transaction information, such as the name of the credit/debit cardholder, credit/debit card number, country, city, state, address, and/or blockchain wallet transactions. We may use third-party vendors to collect and process payment information;
3. Contact information, such as usernames in third party services such as Telegram or Discord, first and last names, email addresses, professional titles, company names, and/or phone numbers;
4. Technical information and usage data, such as statistical and site-related information relating to how a visitor arrived at our websites or platforms, the IP address which may provide information about precise or approximate location, device information, clickstream information and time stamp, and information about how you use our websites and services. We may automatically receive and record such information from our server logs or cookies. For more information, please see the section on Cookies below;
5. Marketing and communications data, such as your preferences in receiving marketing messages from us, your communication preferences and history of communications with us, our service providers or third parties; and/or
6. Other information, which may include your participation in our contests, promotions, or surveys, and photographs, videos and/or audio recordings taken by us or our representatives.

We may also collect and process information from third-party sources, which may include public records, social media platforms, and blockchain data about records or histories of transactions occurring on the applicable blockchain for a blockchain wallet address.

We may also offer features that help users invite or refer their friends or contacts to use our services, and we may collect Personal Data (such as contact details) about these invitees or referrals so we can reach out to them. Please do not refer someone to us or share their contact details or Personal Data with us unless you have their permission or consent to do so. 

While labelling blockchain wallet addresses is an integral part of our business, we do not use Personal Data collected from our users (such as the blockchain wallet addresses in their account or profile information) to add or publish labels or otherwise reveal their identity as a natural person who owns or controls any given blockchain wallet address. We have also adopted and implemented technical and organisational measures to further cement the fact that no such identification using Personal Data collected from our users should occur in the ordinary course of our business. There may be cases where we have labels that may include information revealing of the identity of natural persons (irrespective of whether these are our users) in association with a given blockchain wallet address, for example, the activities carried out by such natural persons on a public and immutable blockchain, including their use of decentralized naming services. If you have any concerns or requests regarding labels in our Services which may affect you, please contact us at support@magickbase.com.
